FINA

Our application is designed to allow users to track their progress in their pursuit of health.
    Features:
        Daily Fitness Page
            This is where users can log exercises with the following parameters:
                - day, muscle, exercise, weight, sets and reps.
            The user can also log their current body weight, as well as their water intake

        Weekly Fitness Page
            This is where users can view their exercises on a three day basis.
                - yesterday, today and tomorrow
            The date automatically updates and places the corresponding exercises in their proper container.

        Exercise History Page
            This is where users can view all the exercises they've logged since they registered. If
            the user made a mistake, they can delete the exercise here and it will no longer be reflected
            on other pages.

        Registration Survey
            This is where the user initially logs their goal water intake, and goal body weight. This is a critical step in filling the data base with information so the user doesn't go into the app with no info.

        Goals
            This is where the user can see their goals, and how close they are to achieving their goals. There is the table for the water goal, which will show the current water goal,the average water daily water intake, and allows the user to set a new water goal. There is a table for the body weight goal which will show the the current body weight goal, the pounds left for the user to reach their goal, and allows the user to set a new body weight goal.

        Dashboard
            Creates an overview of your exercise history, showing your most recent workout for each 
            muscle group. This displays the day you did this workout, the exercise done, weight, sets and 
            reps for the workout.

        Discovery Page
            Allows the user to select a muscle group, and get preset exercises recommended to them.
