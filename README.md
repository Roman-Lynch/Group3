Our application is designed to allow users to track their progress in their pursuit of health.
    Features:
        Daily Fitness Page
            This is where users can log exercises with the following parameters:
                - day, muscle, exercise, weight, sets and reps.
            The user can also log their current body weight, as well as their water intake

        Weekly Fitness Page
            This is where users can view their exercises on a three day basis.
                - yesterday, today and tomorrow
            The date automatically updates and places the corresponding exercises in their proper container.

        Exercise History Page
            This is where users can view all the exercises they've logged since they registered. If
            the user made a mistake, they can delete the exercise here and it will no longer be reflected
            on other pages.
