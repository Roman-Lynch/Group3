FINA

Our application is designed to allow users to track their progress in their pursuit of health.
    Features:
        Fitness Page
                The fitness page is where users can log their workout sessions. The entries include
            the day, muscle group, sets, reps as well as weight. These attributes are user specific and
            displayed in a week by week format. Users are able to view previous sessions by viewing
            the preceeding week.
                Furthermore, the data stored in the users log is used to display progress on the Dashboard.
            More information regarding the specifics of the dashboard can be found in its respective section.
