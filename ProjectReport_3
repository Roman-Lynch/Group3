- Fina is a routine building tool that allows you to track fitness progression. A user is able to track bodyweight and exercise weight with
 an easy to navigate UI. FINA has a daily workout and weekly fitness logging page as well as a dashboard.
 On the daily fitness page a user can log their workout sessions. The entries include day, muscle group, sets, reps, and weight.
 These attributes are user specific and can be displayed in a week by week format on the weekly fitness page. Users are able to 
 view previous sessions by viewing the preceeding week. The data stored on these pages is shown on cards on the dashboard. FINA uses graphs
 and scatter plots to show progression of bodyweight and exercise weight.
